Trying to figure out sessions right now.
Currently what I've been seeing are pages that have the .php extension, something we're trying to avoid.

Generally a page which will take advantage of sessions usually follow this-

<?php
    session_start(); #this part will basically enable the page for session use. 
                        #this loads the user's session.

    if(isset($_GET['logout']) #this is the session ending logic. (example.php?logout=1)
    {
        session_unset(); #frees all session variables currently registered
        session_destroy(); #deletes cookie from user's computer.
        header('Location: example.php'); #this is what clears the url properly once you log out.
    }
    if(isset($_POST['username']))
    {
        #this code will run if someone attempts to log in. or use credentials
    }

?>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>

    <?php
        #$_SESSION['saying'] = 'time is gold'; #this is just an example. 
                                                #even after deleting the code, saying will still have the
                                                # value of time is gold
                                   
    ?>

    <?php if(isset($_SESSION['username'])) { ?>
    You are now logged in.
    <a href = "example.php?logout=1">Logout</a> #error here, url will be embedded, this must be wiped.
                                                    # easiest way to avoid this is to just directly go to example.php directly at our issetlogout logic above
    <?php } else {  ?>
        <form action = "" method="POST">
            username: <input name='username'/>
            password: <input name='password'/>
            <button type ="submit"/>
        </form>
        <?php } ?>
    # the php tags might seem confusing at first, but it helps the parser understand that the code being used
    # is php based.


    </body>
</html>

Now if there's some kind of way to separate this functionality to keep the html extension that would be great.
Because it's client side.

It seems we have little choice.
