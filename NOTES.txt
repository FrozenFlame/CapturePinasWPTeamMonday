Trying to figure out sessions right now.
Currently what I've been seeing are pages that have the .php extension, something we're trying to avoid.

Generally a page which will take advantage of sessions usually follow this-

<?php
    session_start(); #this part will basically enable the page for session use. 
                        #this loads the user's session.

    if(isset($_GET['logout']) #this is the session ending logic. (example.php?logout=1)
    {
        session_unset(); #frees all session variables currently registered
        session_destroy(); #deletes cookie from user's computer.
        header('Location: example.php'); #this is what clears the url properly once you log out.
    }
    if(isset($_POST['username']))
    {
        #this code will run if someone attempts to log in. or use credentials
    }

?>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>

    <?php
        #$_SESSION['saying'] = 'time is gold'; #this is just an example. 
                                                #even after deleting the code, saying will still have the
                                                # value of time is gold
                                   
    ?>

    <?php if(isset($_SESSION['username'])) { ?>
    You are now logged in.
    <a href = "example.php?logout=1">Logout</a> #error here, url will be embedded, this must be wiped.
                                                    # easiest way to avoid this is to just directly go to example.php directly at our issetlogout logic above
    <?php } else {  ?>
        <form action = "" method="POST">
            username: <input name='username'/>
            password: <input name='password'/>
            <button type ="submit"/>
        </form>
        <?php } ?>
    # the php tags might seem confusing at first, but it helps the parser understand that the code being used
    # is php based.


    </body>
</html>

Now if there's some kind of way to separate this functionality to keep the html extension that would be great.
Because it's client side.

It seems we have little choice.

lol more and more apparently I find out that jQuery is harmful for the industry. Whatever our code is a mess right now anyway.

Sample of more than one data return from php

<?php 
     include('db_connection.php'); 
     $c_id = $_POST['c_id'];
     $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM course WHERE c_id = '$c_id'"); 
     $all_course_data = mysql_fetch_array($result);
     $c_name = $all_course_data['c_name'];
     $c_credit = $all_course_data['c_credit']; 
     echo $c_name.",".$c_credit;
     exit();   
?>

here's another:

php:

$data = array(
    'name' => $c_name,
    'credit' => $c_credit,
);
echo json_encode($data);

javascript:

success: function(data) {
    var result = $.parseJSON(data);
    $('#course_name').val(result.name);
    $('#course_credit').val(result.credit);
}

Gonna start checking out some JSON action.

Javascript: 
$.getJSON( "ajax/test.json", function( data ) {
  var items = [];
  $.each( data, function( key, val ) {
    items.push( "<li id='" + key + "'>" + val + "</li>" );
  });
 
  $( "<ul/>", {
    "class": "my-new-list",
    html: items.join( "" )
  }).appendTo( "body" );
});

JSON:
{
  "one": "Singular sensation",  
  "two": "Beady little eyes",
  "three": "Little birds pitch by my doorstep"
}
